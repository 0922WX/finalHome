![Event Propagation](/static/images/event-propagation-in-react/event-propagation.jpg)

In reality Event Propagation concept is quite easy, but people tend to throw lots of words like, "**Bubbling**", "**Capturing**", "**Delegations**"
"**Events going up**", "**Events going down**" those terms confuses peoples minds, yet they all true in their own terms. Event propagation in React works just like in real DOM, _but events wrapped up in SyntheticEvents_.
But this doesnt change anything they still behave as if they are working on your browser. So learning this concept in React pretty much appliable to anywhere where the DOM exists, at least
some form of it.

Now, we try to emphasize those buzz-words one by one starting with **Bubbling**.
