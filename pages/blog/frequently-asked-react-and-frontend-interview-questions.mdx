It's been a long time since writing a blog post. Because of my day job, I was quite occupied and tired and because of my recent job searching,
I wanted to write about the interview questions that I faced all the time. So, here we go.

## Var vs Let vs Const

Actually, `var` and `let` is pretty similar only difference is `var` is function scoped and `let` is block scoped.
It can also be said `var` is more like a global variable whereas `let` is only valid inside its parent parenthesis.
The main reason we use `let` is to avoid [Hosting](#what-is-hoisting) which I'll explain two minutes later in this post.
Finally, `const` is a **constant** value that cannot be changed once defined.
There are some exceptions which usually interviewers asks once you said you cannot change a `const` value once defined.
Such as what if I push a variable inside `const arr = []` array then what happens? It works since you don't **re-assign** the value.
There is one more trap question interviewer might ask what if I do this below code piece then what happens?

```javascript
const obj = {};
obj.someValue = 'Does it work?';
```

Yeah, it works. It creates _key_ called `someValue` and _value_ called `Does it work?`. That's all you have to know about var, let and const.

## What Is Hoisting?

Before, `let` and `const` introduced people had to use `var` since there were no alternatives.
That caused a interesting problem called hoisting which is basically using variable before its definition. It's easier to show then write. Come along.

```javascript
// calling x after definition
var x = 5;
console.log(x, '\n');

// calling y after definition
let y = 10;
console.log(y, '\n');

// calling var z before definition will return undefined
console.log(z, '\n');
var z = 2;

// calling let a before definition will give error
console.log(a);
let a = 3;
```

You see, when `var` used javascript won't complain and returns **undefined** which is pretty annoying. But, when we use `let` javascript complains and says you cannot call a variable before definition and throws **Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization**

## What Is Closures?

Arghh, tough one. Interviewers loves closures, dunno why 😅. Let's get over it. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) document says

> A closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Closures are also like hoisting its lot easier to show.

```javascript
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    name = 'Chrome';
    console.log('Inner function --> ', name); // Returns Inner function --> Chrome
  }
  console.log('Outer function --> ', name); // Returns Outer function --> Mozilla
  displayName();
}
init();
```

As you can see we did not change the outer value. It only changes if we call `displayName()` closure.
That is a primitive way of emulating private values since JS doesn't have private class fields like other languages such as C#, Java and C++.
One practical use of closures may be [Debounce](#debounce) which I'll talk later. Finally, be careful while using this technique may lead to memory leak and performance issues.

## Most Commonly Used Functions Map, Filter, Find and Reduce

### Map

Fancy way of doing your iterations but, also functional way of iterating over elements. One of the key things to know that `map` is a **array method** and **returns a new array** after computation finishes.
Few use cases.

```javascript
const arr = [🍇, 🍈 , 🍉, 🍊];
arr.map(fruit => fruit) // Returns [🍇, 🍈 , 🍉, 🍊]

const arr = [2,4,5,6];
arr.map(number => number * number) // Returns [4,16,25,36]

```

By the way, if you don't need the returned array don't use map it's an anti-pattern use `forEach` instead since it does not return an array.

So, you shouldn't be using `map` if:

- you're not using the array it returns; and/or
- you're not returning a value from the callback.
