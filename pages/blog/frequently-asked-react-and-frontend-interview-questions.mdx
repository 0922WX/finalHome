It's been a long time since I write a blog post. because of my day job, I was quite occupied and tired and because of my recent job searching,
I wanted to write about the interview questions that I faced all the time. So, here we go.

## Var vs Let vs Const

Actually, `var` and `let` is pretty similar only difference is `var` is function scoped and `let` is block scoped.
It can also be said `var` is more like a global variable whereas `let` is only valid inside its parent parenthesis.
The main reason we use `let` is to avoid [Hosting](#what-is-hoisting) which I'll explain two minutes later in this post.
Finally, `const` is a **constant** value that cannot be changed once defined.
There are some exceptions which usually interviewers asks once you said you cannot change a `const` value once defined.
Such as what if I push a variable inside `const arr = []` array then what happens? It works since you don't **re-assign** the value.
There is one more trap question interviewer might ask what if I do this below code piece then what happens?

```javascript
const obj = {};
obj.someValue = 'Does it work?';
```

Yeah, it works. It creates _key_ called `someValue` and _value_ called `Does it work?`. That's all you have to know about var, let and const.

## What Is Hoisting?

Before, `let` and `const` introduced people had to use `var` since there were no alternatives.
That caused a interesting problem called hoisting which is basically using variable before its definition. It's easier to show then write. Come along.

```javascript
// calling x after definition
var x = 5;
console.log(x, '\n');

// calling y after definition
let y = 10;
console.log(y, '\n');

// calling var z before definition will return undefined
console.log(z, '\n');
var z = 2;

// calling let a before definition will give error
console.log(a);
let a = 3;
```

You see, when `var` used javascript won't complain and returns **undefined** which is pretty annoying. But, when we use `let` javascript complains and says you cannot call a variable before definition and throws **Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization**

## What Is Closures?

Arghh, tough one. Interviewers loves closures, dunno why 😅. Let's get over it. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) document says

> A closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Closures are also like hoisting its a lot easier to show.

```javascript
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    name = 'Chrome';
    console.log('Inner function --> ', name); // Returns Inner function --> Chrome
  }
  console.log('Outer function --> ', name); // Returns Outer function --> Mozilla
  displayName();
}
init();
```

As you can see we did not change the outer value. It only changes if we call `displayName()` closure.
That is a primitive way of emulating private values since JS doesn't have private class fields like other languages such as C#, Java and C++.
One practical use of closures may be [Debounce](#debounce) which I'll talk later. Finally, be careful while using this technique may lead to memory leak and performance issues.

## Most Commonly Used Functions Map, Filter, Find and Reduce

### Map

The map is a functional way of iterating over elements. One of the important things to know that `map` is an **array method** and **returns a new array** after computation finishes.
Few use cases.

```javascript
const arr = [🍇, 🍈 , 🍉, 🍊];
arr.map(fruit => fruit) // Returns [🍇, 🍈 , 🍉, 🍊]

const arr = [2,4,5,6];
arr.map(number => number * number) // Returns [4,16,25,36]

```

By the way, if you don't need the returned array don't use `map` it's an anti-pattern use `forEach` instead since it does not return an array.

So, you shouldn't be using `map` if:

- you're not using the array it returns; and/or
- you're not returning a value from the callback.

### Filter

Like `map`, `filter` is an array method that takes conditions to filter out elements.

```javascript
const arr = [🍇, 🍈 , 🍉, 🍊,🍇,🍇];
arr.filter(fruit => fruit === 🍇) // Returns [🍇, 🍇 , 🍇]

//OR

arr.filter(fruit => fruit !== 🍇) // Returns [🍈 , 🍉, 🍊]
```

### Find

The `find` method returns the first element that satisfies the provided condition.

```javascript
const obj = [
  { name: 'John', age: 18 },
  { name: 'Ash', age: 19 },
  { name: 'John', age: 20 },
];

obj.find((x) => x.name === 'John'); // Returns {name: "John", age: 18}
```

I intentionally left two **Johns** there to show that `find()` method returns the first element that satisfies the condition not the second one`{name: 'John', age: 20}`.

### Reduce

`reduce()` is extremely versetile method. You can do pretty much everything you can do with `map()`. I'll go over with some examples.

```javascript
const people = [
  { id: '1', name: 'John', age: 18 },
  { id: '2', name: 'Smith', age: 18 },
  { id: '3', name: 'Ashy', age: 12 },
];

people.reduce((acc, person) => acc + person.age, 0); // Returns 48. Total age of people.

people.reduce((acc, person) => {
  if (acc !== null) return acc;
  if (person.name === 'John') return person;
  return null;
}, null);

people.reduce((acc, person) => {
  if (person.age > 25) {
    acc = [...acc, person];
  }
  return acc;
}, []);
```

As you can see, our first `reducer` returned `48`, second one returned `{id: "1", name: "John", age: 18}` and third one returned `[{id: "1", name: "John", age: 18}, {id: "2", name: "Smith", age: 35}]`.
If I have to explain how it works `reduce` works like a `recursive function`. The first parameter behaves as an accumulator basically holds our total value.
So, each time reducer works it iterates over person ages and adds them to accumulator then finally returns the sum of the total. That was how the first reducer works. The second one is pretty straight forward, its a `find()` method implemented in the reducer. Looks for `John` in peoples array when it finds `John` return associated object.
The third `reducers` works similar to `filter()` method it actually `filter()` implemented in `reduce`. It iterates over peoples array and looks for person who's age greater than 25.

## Optional Chaining

Long before **optional chaining** added to Ecmascript, we had to do lots of hacky stuff to ensure data is not undefined. Things like this `person && person.car && person.car.wheels` if `person.car` is undefined and you have not used `&&` then you are screwed,
because Javascript will throw `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined`. This piece of code will ruin your life in runtime 😅. So, instead people came up with something like that to prevent **undefined errors**

```javascript
const adventurer = {
  name: 'Alice',
  cat: {
    name: 'Dinah',
  },
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName);
```

Javascript will not complain about this and simply return `undefined` and you are good to go.

## Null Coalescing Operator vs Logical Operator

First, let me tell you what `||` and `??` those are. The first one is **Logical Or** and the second one is **Nullish coalescing operator**. Let's go over first one with examples.

```javascript
console.log(false || 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
console.log(undefined || 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
console.log(null || 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
console.log(0 || 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
```

All of those will return `Hello`, because **Logical Or** first evaluates left side of the operation, if its **_true_** then returns left side if its not returns right side.

```javascript
console.log(false ?? 'Hello'); //Returns false
console.log(undefined ?? 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
console.log(null ?? 'Hello'); //Returns Hello
console.log(0 ?? 'Hello'); //Returns 0
```

This one is a bit tricky, due to **Nullish coalescing operator**'s nature, if left side of the operation is either **_false_** or **_0_** it will return left side but if it is **_null_** or **_undefined_** then it will return `Hello`.

## Bind vs Arrow Function

### Binding

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this);
  }

  clickHandler() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.clickHandler}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}
```

### Arrow Function

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  clickHandler = () => {
    console.log(this);
  };

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.clickHandler}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}
```

They pretty much similar apart from their syntax. People used **_Binding_** before **_Arrow Functions_** included in ES6. So, tell your interviewer that if s/he want to avoid **code smells** s/he should be use arrow functions,
its way more readable and understandable.

## What Is SPA

> A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)

This is a general definition, but let me tell you how thi works in React.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

If you have no idea about React, this `<App />` piece of code actually stands as gateway to our React app. All the components you make will reside in `<App />`.
And, this component will be getting rendered in `<div id="root"></div>` this div.
So, whenever React gets rerendered you are actually still in the same page but only requested parts of the app changes.
Also, if you check out the url of your browser it also stays same, because you never left the page.
