If you ever had to deal with binaries in Javascript, you know you can't escape from **_Bitwise_** operators. I know because, over the last two week or so,
I've spent my time to build a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator in Javascript, and I had to implement a CPU in Javascript. And, of course, Without the knowledge of neither binaries nor bitwise operators
such implementation would be impossible. That is why, today, we are going to talk about how to become a kickass bitwise ninja. But, before start talking about binaries in general we should have solid understanding regarding:

- What is Binary ?
- What is Byte ?
- What is Hexadecimal ?

### Binary

As you may have heard, binaries nothing but ones and zeros streaming through your hardware. Logical example for binary would be, a _Light Bulb_.
A light bulb has only two states; it's either open(1) or close(0). You may ask yourself, how do only two digits make up all this stuff?
The good thing is we can combine the values like `0101` or `1000` etc. With having more ones in hand we can construct a meaningful things such as:
_Colors_, _Strings_, _Numbers_.

| Length | Name   | Example  |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1      | Bit    | 1        |
| 4      | Nibble | 1111     |
| 8      | Byte   | 10111111 |

Everything is consist of **_Bits_**, **_Nibbles_** and **_Bytes_**. If there is only one it's a **_Bit_**, if there are 4 bits it's a **_Nibble_**, if there are 8 bits it's a **_Byte_**.
If you are curious, in Javascript to reveal the secret of binaries we have few options:

```javascript
0b1111; // If you type this in your browser's console it will prompt: 15
parseInt(1111, 2); // This will also prompt: 15

Number(15).toString(2); // toString() turns your value into base-2 format which is binary
```

If you are wondering how `1111` become `15` don't worry I got you. Key thing to remember everything is at base-2 format.

```javascript

   1       1       1         1
   ‚Üì       ‚Üì       ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   2¬≥      2¬≤      2¬π        2‚Å∞
   ‚Üì       ‚Üì       ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   8   +   4   +   2     +   1  = 15
```

### Hexadecimal

Hexadecimals(also base 16) aren't so different than bytes. If we wanted to display decimal `255` in binary format we would have something like this: `0b11111111` 8-bit long digits.
But, what if we wanted to display `4095` or `65535`. You see where this is going it's becoming more and more difficult to present them in binary(base-2) format. Instead of
displaying them as binaries people come up with hexadecimal to present them in more readable format.

| Decimal | Binary                | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| 255     | 0b1111 1111           | 0xFF        |
| 4095    | 0b1111 1111 1111      | 0xFFF       |
| 65535   | 0b1111 1111 1111 1111 | 0xFFFF      |

To make these calculations at your browser:

```javascript
0x1111; // If you type this in your browser's console it will prompt: 4369
parseInt(1111, 16); // This will also prompt: 4369

Number(4369).toString(16); // toString() turns your value into base-16 format which is hexadecimal
```

Let's see how does your browser make that calculation.

```javascript

   1       1       1         1
   ‚Üì       ‚Üì       ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   16¬≥      16¬≤    16¬π       16‚Å∞
   ‚Üì       ‚Üì       ‚Üì         ‚Üì
 4,096  +  256  +  16    +   1  = 4369
```

Now, if you are curious about `0xFF`, in hexadecimal we are not limited by `1` and `0` we can also use other numbers up to `9`, but what comes after `9` ?
Let's see.

| Decimal | Hexadecimal | Binary |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0           | 0000   |
| 1       | 1           | 0001   |
| 2       | 2           | 0010   |
| 3       | 3           | 0011   |
| 4       | 4           | 0100   |
| 5       | 5           | 0101   |
| 6       | 6           | 0110   |
| 7       | 7           | 0111   |
| 8       | 8           | 1000   |
| 9       | 9           | 1001   |
| 10      | A           | 1010   |
| 11      | B           | 1011   |
| 12      | C           | 1100   |
| 13      | D           | 1101   |
| 14      | E           | 1110   |
| 15      | F           | 1111   |

Now you have an adequate amount of knowledge to see why `0xFF` becomes `255`.

Let's sum up **_Hexadecimals_**

- It's in base-16 format.
- It's consist of bytes.
- Each Hexadecimal digit represents four bits.
- The prefix `0x` used.

## Bitwise Operators

**Bitwise** operations works on binary format at the level of individual bits. It's lot faster than doing arithmetic operations supported by programming languages.
If you are used to low-level programming, you are probably already familiar with these concepts. Nonetheless if you are trying to build a pseudo-CPU, low-level programming or
learn more about memory efficiency in Javascript, please, read on.

There are several operators:

- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOT
- LEFT SHIFT
- RIGHT SHIFT
