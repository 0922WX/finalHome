React attempts to be as unopinionated as possible. This is both it's greatest strength _and_ weakness.

Over the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.
This article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of
different approaches for styling.

## Vanilla CSS

Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.

```html:index.html
<h1 class="header">Welcome</h1>
```

```css:index.css
.header {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

As I built more large applications, I began to understand some of the drawbacks.

- **Reusability.** It's easy to create append-only stylesheets that become very complex.
- **Global Namespace.** Since CSS has a [global namespace](https://css-tricks.com/regarding-css-global-scope/), you can unintentionally target too many elements.
- **Colocation.** It's hard to modularize your CSS, which makes it difficult to delete code safely.

At this point, I was introduced to [CSS pre-processors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor).
These tools aim to introduce new funtionality and compile back to vanilla CSS.

## Sass

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), one of the most popular preprocessors, allows you to write more reusable, maintainable CSS.
Some of the most popular features are [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), and [modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules).

- **Variables.** I want to define global values once and share them throughout my stylesheets.
- **Mixins.** I want to reuse particular snippets of CSS.
- **Modules.** I want to split up my CSS files for a more maintainable codebase.

```scss:_base.scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

```scss:_header.scss
@use 'base';

.header {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

Sass helped me write more modular, reusable CSS – at least, for a while. Over time, I ran into new issues.

- **Naming.** As your CSS grows, it's easy to have class names get out of hand.
- **Browser support.** Certain features aren't [supported across all browsers](https://caniuse.com/) and require [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) like `-moz-` (Firefox), `-webkit-` (Safari), and `-ms-` (Internet Explorer and Edge).

To solve naming, I started to adopt [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).
Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components
and organize CSS in a modular way, which keeps specificity low.

```html
<button class="button">Cancel</button> <button class="button button--primary">Submit</button>
```

```css
.button {
  color: black;
  background-color: gray;
}

.button--primary {
  color: white;
  background-color: green;
}
```

Naming conventions helped but didn't fix the root cause: **naming is hard**.
For browser support, it's possible to set up your Sass toolchain with a tool like [autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) to handle vendor prefixes.
However, around this time, I started using component-based frameworks like React. This led me to explore CSS-in-JS.

## CSS-in-JS

My first adventure with CSS-in-JS: building a [component library with styled-components](/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components). At first, CSS-in-JS solved all my problems.

- **Specificity** is solved by auto-generated class names.
- **Colocation** is solved by putting CSS directly with the component, making it easy to delete code.
- **Browser support** is solved by having autoprefixer built-in.
- **Variables** are solved by creating a global theme.

However, **naming** was still a huge pain.

As the component library grew, I began to explore [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/).
These were more structured approaches to scaling CSS-in-JS to help enforce a design system.
Plus, they helped solve naming. Trying to scale [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) alone in a large application made me get _really_ creative with names.
You can only have so many container, wrapper, layout things. For example:

```js
const HomeContainerWrapper = styled.div`
   padding: 8px;
   font-weight: bold;
   color: white;
   background: blue;
`;

<HomeContainerWrapper>
  Hello
</HomeContainerWrapper>

// Forget about naming
<Box
  padding={3}
  fontWeight='bold'
  color='white'
  bg='blue'
>
  Hello
</Box>
```

Over the years, I've had many resume iterations. As I moved into my [new role](/blog/2019) last month, I went to update my resume — That's when I realized it was terrible.

This is going to be a sort of _resume retrospective_. Basically, I'm just going to roast myself. Laugh at my mistakes and learn from my failures.

## 2016 Resume

This was my resume out of college which helped me land my first full-time engineering job. There were more resume iterations before this, obviously, but they were terrible.
Let me save _some_ dignity.

![2016 Resume](/static/images/resume/2016.jpg)

Okay, I'll start with the **good**.

- It's one page. The layout is clean and comfortable to read. Good job, Lee.
- The job title is more prominent than the employer.
- Most bullet points are useful (not too much content).
- Projects and GPA are still relevant because I'm fresh out of college.

What about the **bad**?

- This thing is written with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Why? Because that's what everyone on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) did. Talk about over-engineering.
- My middle name is not relevant. My name isn't that generic.
- My phone number is not needed. This trend persisted for a while.
- Some of the bullet points talk about _what_ I did instead of the _impact_ I made.
- "Videographer" is not relevant to the position I'm interviewing for.

## 2017 Resume

In 2017, I got the bright idea to re-design my resume. The content didn't change much.

![2017 Resume](/static/images/resume/2017.jpg)

There's some **good**:

- At a glance, you can quickly parse the content.
- Easy to read font.
- Education moved down now that I have a full-time job.

There are some **issues**, though:

- This custom Photoshop design did _not_ work well with Applicant Tracking Systems, or [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) for short. Which is, ya know, the whole point 🤦🏻‍♂️
- The location of the companies is not relevant.

## 2018 Resume

In 2018, [I switched jobs](/blog/joining-hy-vee). Time to dust off the ol' resume. But, just when you thought it couldn't get worse...

**I made this thing with InDesign**.

It had an embedded font. Well, it turns out the embedded font didn't work in Firefox. So the resume was basically unreadable in some cases.

![2018 Resume](/static/images/resume/2018.jpg)

I don't have much good to say here, so let's just go straight to the **bad**:

- The about section is a complete waste of space. Save it for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leejamesrobinson/).
- References are not needed on the resume.
- I'm not sure why I decided to drop the start and end dates from my work positions. "3 years" isn't very descriptive.
- The GitHub link is unnecessary. You can find it on my website.

## 2019 Resume

Brace yourself. We've now reached peak monstrosity.

I finally gave up on custom designs and opted to use a service called [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/). It was easy, required little maintenance, and worked much better with ATS.

Plus, I thought, let's add every single thing I've ever accomplished. I committed the ultimate sin. **I made a two-page resume.**

![2019 Resume](/static/images/resume/2019.jpg)

Some things are **good**:

- The skills section made a comeback. ATS love those buzzwords.
- Some of the newer bullet points have excellent metrics.
- It's a wonderful design. Easy to read.

But others are **bad**. Really bad:

- I've been out of college long enough that I can drop the internships.
- Instead of putting freelance dev work, I put a project ([dsmtech](https://dsmtech.io)).
- GPA is not relevant anymore. Then again... was it ever relevant?
- Did I mention it's 2 pages? No one has time for that.

## 2020 Resume

That brings us [to now](/robinson-resume-2019.pdf). Behold, this single sheet of (digital) paper.

![2020 Resume](/static/images/resume/2020.jpg)

I made this with Pages on Mac. No custom fonts. No crazy design.
I'd like to think it's the culmination of all the points made above.

- It's easy to update and maintain.
- The font is readable, and there's a good use of bold and italic.
- Unnecessary information is omitted (GPA, projects, internships, phone number).
- More relevant information is included (skills, freelance work).
- Industry normalized job title (Software Engineer III -> Senior Software Engineer).
- There are clear start/end dates with the same format throughout.
- Proper use of whitespace.

You don't need a two-page resume.
